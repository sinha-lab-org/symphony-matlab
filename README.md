# Symphony

Symphony is a MATLAB based data acquisition system for electrophysiologists. It provides a framework for writing acquisition routines and a user interface to conduct experiments.

## Clone

`git clone git@github.com:sinha-lab-org/symphony-matlab.git`

## Build

Matlab functions in the root directory are used to build the project. The scripts are named according to the build phase they execute. The phases include:

- `test`: run tests using the Matlab unit test framework
- `package`: package the project into a .mlappinstall file
- `install`: install the packaged product into Matlab

Similar to the [Maven Build Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html), each phase will execute all phases before it (i.e. running `install` will execute `test`, `package`, `install`). In addition there is a `site` script to generate the project's documentation from the [wiki](https://github.com/Symphony-DAS/symphony-matlab/wiki).

## Directory Structure

The project directory structure generally follows the [Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).
